I can try a different style or mood if you'd like! Tell me:\n\n*   **What kind of song were you hoping for?** (e.g., happy, sad, funny, rock, folk, etc.)\n*   **Is there a particular topic you'd like the song to be about?** (e.g., love, friendship, nature, a specific animal, etc.)\n*   **Do you prefer a fast or slow tempo?**\n\nThe more information you give me, the better I can tailor the song to your taste! ðŸ˜„\n",
